            I am a computer engineer with a focus on front-end development 
            and experience in Angular and Flutter. I have also worked as a UX designer, utilizing my technical skills to create user-friendly and visually appealing designs. In the last two years, I have taken on the role of project manager for the digitization 
            plan at Paltel, leading a team to successfully implement digital solutions for the company.

            <h1>Why i'm  applying for ReactJS ?</h1>
            <p>
                I am excited to join a ReactJS training program as I am looking to re-enter 
                the programming field after a two-year hiatus. During this time, I taught myself programming and familiarized myself with the latest technologies. However, I am now ready to take my skills to the next level and refresh my knowledge with a more formal training program. Furthermore, as a front-end programmer, I believe that ReactJS is an essential skill that will give me a competitive edge in the job market. I am eager to learn from industry experts and gain hands-on experience working with ReactJS. I am confident that this training will provide me with the tools
                 and knowledge I need to excel in my career and take on new opportunities as a front-end programmer.
